# EEBD2024
This repository contains all six hands-on assignments from the EEBG-Sat 2024 summer school and my solutions to them.

The EEBG-Sat 2024 summer school was organized by the Mangul Lab at the University of Southern California and held at the Technical University of Moldova in Chisinau. EEBG stands for Eastern European Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics.
